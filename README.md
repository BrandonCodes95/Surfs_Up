# Overview 

The purpose of this analysis was to compare temperatures for the weather in Oahu, Hawaii to help inform potential business owners on if their business model would be sustainable year-round. The model is surfing equipment and ice cream, which would need ideal conditions to ensure their customers are outsides and looking to enjoy the water and a cool down with their favorite ice cream! Through gathering the temperatures from 7 years of data for select months, one in the summer and one in the winter. This analysis has a break-down of the descriptive statistics of the temperature.

## Summary 

Overall Oahu has great weather year around with drops in temperature during the winter as expected, but most likely at night when the sun is down and the average temperature drops from 71 F to 56 F. As long as the show operates during day light hours in the winter it should still be profitable. Another analysis I would look into is the percentage of cloudiness each of these months get. Since in the winter months the sun will be a big factor in keeping the temperature warm it would be critical to know how often it is blocked by clouds and rain. I would also look into any potential wind speeds as they can also impact daily temperature and even the waves that their customers would ride on.
